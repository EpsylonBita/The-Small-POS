# Phase 8 Summary (Historical)

## Purpose

Provide a short narrative summary of the Phase 8 milestone and point readers to current operational documentation.

## Milestone Outcome

Phase 8 marked the first shipping-ready baseline for:

- installer/release distribution,
- diagnostics visibility,
- and support incident handling.

This milestone remains valid historically, but active runtime contracts and operational gates are now documented elsewhere.

## Where To Look For Current State

- Runtime architecture: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Release process: `RELEASE.md`
- Support runbook: `SUPPORT.md`
- Active parity gates/checklist: `PARITY_GATES.md`, `PARITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- Security/native migration ledger: `docs/security-native-migration/EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md`

## Notes

Phase 8 documents are retained for migration history only. Do not use this file as the live source of truth for native runtime contract details.
